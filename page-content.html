        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) first coined in 1999 by Kevin Ashton, has gained massive traction in technology
            by
            weaving physical and digital entities to facilitate human-human, human-machine, and even machine-machine
            interactions (Zhang, 2020). IoT is the network between physical entities (things) or digital entities
            (Internet
            devices or systems) that communicate through software, sensors, and other measuring properties for the
            primary
            purpose of data exchange. An aspect of the smart appliance and consumer field that is woven into daily
            lifestyles and is practically undistinguishable is a smartphone.</p>
